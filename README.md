# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-TensorFlow---Keras

• Customised Fashion MNIST dataset by replacing it with handwritten 0-9 digits original MNIST dataset 
• Detected the handwritten digit by running auto-encoders like basics, de-noising, and ECG 
• Performed tests with activation functions (ReLu and Sigmoid) and also added hidden layers (Convolution)
